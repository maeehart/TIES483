The more electricity you buy, the better price you get per kwH and the buying prize of electricity follows function $f(x) = 1-0.01x$, where $0\\leq x\\leq50$ is the amount of electricity you buy. On the other hand, the price that you get from selling electricity follows function $g(x) = 2-0.01x^2$ with $x$ again the amount of electricity that you sell. Formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the profit.\n",
